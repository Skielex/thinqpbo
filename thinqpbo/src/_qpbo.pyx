        Nodes in U^0 are labeled, nodes in U^1, ..., U^k are unlabeled.
        (To find out to what region node i belongs, call GetRegion(i)).
        The user can use these regions as follows:
        -- For each r=1..k, compute somehow minimum x^r of the energy corresponding to region U^r.
            This energy can be obtained by calling GetPairwiseTerm() for edges inside the region.
            (There are no unary terms). Note that computing the global minimum is NP-hard;
            it is up to the user to decide how to solve this problem.
        -- Set the labeling by calling SetLabel().
        -- Call Stitch(). It will compute a complete global minimum (in linear time).
        -- Call GetLabel() for nodes in U^1, ..., U^k to read new solution.
        Note that if the user can provides approximate rather than global minima x^r, then the stitching
        can still be done but the result is not guaranteed to be a *global* minimum.
