                    Minimizing non-submodular functions with graph cuts - a review
                    Technical report MSR-TR-2006-100, July 2006. To appear in PAMI.

                Nodes in U^0 are labeled, nodes in U^1, ..., U^k are unlabeled.
                (To find out to what region node i belongs, call GetRegion(i)).
                The user can use these regions as follows:
                -- For each r=1..k, compute somehow minimum x^r of the energy corresponding to region U^r.
                    This energy can be obtained by calling GetPairwiseTerm() for edges inside the region.
                    (There are no unary terms). Note that computing the global minimum is NP-hard;
                    it is up to the user to decide how to solve this problem.
                -- Set the labeling by calling SetLabel().
                -- Call Stitch(). It will compute a complete global minimum (in linear time).
                -- Call GetLabel() for nodes in U^1, ..., U^k to read new solution.
                Note that if the user can provides approximate rather than global minima x^r, then the stitching
                can still be done but the result is not guaranteed to be a *global* minimum.

                GetRegion()/Stitch() can be called only immediately after ComputeWeakPersistencies().
                NOTE: Stitch() changes the stored energy!
